# Firebase Realtime Database QuotaExceededError - False Positives

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Firebase Realtime Database throws a `QuotaExceededError` even when no actual quota is exceeded.  The issue appears random and the error message provides little debugging information.

## Reproducing the Bug

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install the required packages: `npm install`
3.  Run the app: `node quotaExceededBug.js`
4.  Observe the erratic behavior and `QuotaExceededError` messages.

## Solution

The solution, provided in `quotaExceededSolution.js`, involves meticulous checks on data size and structure, along with careful handling of potential race conditions and asynchronous operations.  It focuses on avoiding unnecessary writes and optimizing the database interaction.

This problem highlights the importance of robust error handling and logging when working with Firebase.  Always implement a logging system to record not only errors but also successful operations to gain insights into your application's data flow.
