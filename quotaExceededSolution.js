The solution involves multiple strategies to reduce database load and handle asynchronous operations efficiently:

1. **Data Size Optimization:** Minimize the size of data written to the database. Avoid unnecessary nesting and use efficient data structures. 
2. **Batch Writing:** Group multiple write operations into batches to reduce the frequency of database interactions.
3. **Transactions:** Utilize transactions for operations that need to be atomic. This prevents inconsistencies due to race conditions.
4. **Data Validation:** Implement strong data validation at the client-side to prevent writing invalid or oversized data to the database.
5. **Asynchronous Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling for asynchronous operations to catch and log any issues. 
6. **Monitoring:** Closely monitor Firebase usage statistics to identify actual quota limitations if the above steps don't resolve the issue.
